It's been quite a while since I've written anything, this being an understatement since it's been over a year.

## What has happened since 2022?

In my last article, I mentioned beginning a life away from home and moving to Ciudad de Mexico. A lot has changed since then! I loved my stay there and maybe I'll write up an in-depth review of my stay there, but given I already have plans to stay there again for a month or more this year I may hold off until then.

But I figured I'd put up a short list of what I've been up to:

- Lived in Ciudad de México (Mexico City 🇲🇽) for 3 months in the beginning of 2022.

- Moved back to Dallas 🇺🇸 afterwards for another 3 months or so.

- Visited/stayed in Lima, Peru 🇵🇪 from June until August.

- Went straight from Peru to Medellín, Colombia 🇨🇴 from August until mid-September.

- Moved back to the US after another 3-4 months outside of the country in mid-September until New Years.

- Flew back to my hometown of Oakland, CA for the first time in 2-3 years or so for Christmas. I promptly flew back to Dallas after 4 days here to prepare to leave the US again.

- Spent New Years on the plane from the US to Barcelona, Spain 🇪🇸, where I stayed for 5 weeks.

- Boarded a flight from Barcelona to Sevilla, Spain in mid February where I spent another 3 weeks.

- During my stay in Sevilla, took the train to Granada, Spain 🇪🇸 where I spent my 30th birthday weekend 🎉🎂

- Took a train from Sevilla to Madrid, Spain 🇪🇸 where I am now as I write this in a small café.

All-in-all this past year or two has been pretty crazy in terms of all that I've been up to when I look back on it. I'll have to make sure to document/write about some of the things that have happened in more detail, but I just wanted to get out a quick update in case people still think I'm in CDMX 😅

Thanks for reading!
